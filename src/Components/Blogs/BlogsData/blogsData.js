10. Bias in Hiring

  content: `
Marketing Strategy

Definition: Marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan that outlines how a business will achieve its marketing goals. It encompasses all aspects of marketing, including both digital and traditional methods.

Key Components:
• Market Research: Understanding your target audience, market conditions, and competitors.
• Target Audience: Defining who your ideal customers are.
• Positioning: Determining how you want your brand to be perceived in the market.
• Value Proposition: Articulating the unique value your product or service offers to customers.
• Marketing Channels: Deciding which channels (digital, traditional, etc.) to use for reaching your audience.
• Goals and Objectives: Setting specific, measurable goals for your marketing efforts.
• Budget: Allocating resources and budget to various marketing activities.
• Tactics and Implementation: Outlining the specific actions and campaigns to execute the strategy.

Focus: Marketing strategy is about the overarching plan and approach for achieving business objectives through marketing efforts. It includes both digital and non-digital methods.

Digital Marketing

Definition: Digital marketing encompasses all marketing efforts that use electronic devices and the internet. It includes tactics and channels used to reach customers online.

Key Components:
• Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Improving website visibility in search engine results.
• Content Marketing: Creating and sharing valuable content to attract and engage your audience.
• Social Media Marketing: Using social media platforms to promote products, engage with customers, and build brand awareness.
